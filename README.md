# Robot_Emotion_Classification
Building various Machine Learning models to help classify the emotions that are being projected by Tele-Operated robots when remotely handled by humans.

The Machine Learning models explored in this project are:
1. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3. Random Forest
4. Multilayer Perceptrons

8 participants had participated in a supervised experiment to perform a task while trying to portray different emotions.
The data collected from the robot arm is segmented as per the task to remove any unnecessary motions captured.
The models are trained with this data and the results are evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix and ROC-PRC curve.
